#Stay tuned
Currently I am merging my existing github repositories, to have the simulations and blocklists at one place. 
This could take a few days.

After maintenance, the following folders should be restored:

1. Python scripts
⋅⋅1. Simulations
⋅⋅2. 
2. DNS-blocklists
⋅⋅1. .vbs .bat and Windows tasks to easily change between different DNS schemes. 
⋅⋅2. File(s) containing the current blocklists, whitelists not provided anymore.
⋅⋅3. Optionally iptables and pfsense configurations.
