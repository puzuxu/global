##  Updating current repository (01/08)

Currently I am merging my existing github repositories, to have the simulations and blocklists at one place. 
I have to determine what I'd like to upload here and what to provide upon request.
This merging could take a few days.

After maintenance, the following folders should be restored:

1. Python scripts
   1. Simulations
   2. To be determined.
2. DNS-blocklists
   1. .vbs .bat -files and Windows tasks to easily change between different DNS schemes. 
   2. File(s) containing the current blocklists, whitelists not provided anymore.
   3. Optionally iptables and pfsense configurations.
3. To be determined.
